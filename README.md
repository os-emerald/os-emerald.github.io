# UNFINISHED WEBSITE!!!!!!!!!!

## Hello!!! Welcome to The Emerald Foundation (perca Emerald OS)!

### So... what is it? 

The Emerald Foundation is a special app that emulates the Nintendo Wii console like no other -- converting it into something brand spanking new and best yet: not having super weird arcitechture! This means that anyone of any nation can freely make games for this OS!

### And who can work on it?

Anyone and everyone can work on this project!

### How much does it cost? 

$99 + shipping... I'm kidding! It's all free!

### Does this go against any laws or rules?

Nope! It's all made by us, or made with us in mind -- anything hinting to Nintendo is strictly theirs, and theirs only. We only use the Wii as an example, just like how Android uses Apple as an example for a lot of things. 

### What devices does this support?

Currently Android (up to version 7), Windows 7/10/11+ and Linux are supported as of right now if you would like to make apps for this project. Wanna try it out for yourself? Just get a WiFi driver and an HTML reader and you're set!

### What about storage? Are the games I play saved?

They're saved as best as they can be. The author of each game will need to go over how much bytes of data will be used because even though data stored into the system can be at any one given time, it's slow and unreliable especially if you ARE one of those gamers.
- Our system allows the storing of 13 107 200 bytes. Storage is measured in socket and 1 socket is equal to 256 bytes, meaning games can use up to 51 200 sockets of data, although most games will use 8 to 256 sockets. No two games can use the same sockets unless they have the same publish name. As updates come, sockets will be rewritten as the asset data will be transferrable to the system storage where the sockets used for "data.png" stuff will go away and never be seen again.
- Sockets can be rewritten by deleting the game or /sectorize delete [sector x] [sector y] [your PIN], which will corrupt any and all games that use the sectors in between X and Y. Will not delete but WILL show an Unknown App embed.
- Regular mp3 and mp4 videos will not work in this app due to the lack of storage options and the lack of compression options as well. We cannot add this in the future because Unicode is not super compressible yet. When it comes to be so, we will embed an mp3 and mp4 viewer in the app.
  - Look at README-SOLUTIONS.md for the solutions to any issues you may have, like for example the video stuff.

## ESTIMATED ETA TIME FOR RELEASE: 31st March, 2025, give or take 2 weeks.
