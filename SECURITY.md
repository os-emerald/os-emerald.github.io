# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

***NO*** versions are currently supported as of right now. The first will be Emerald 0.0.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Go to the issues tab to report a vulnerability. Most will get resolved within 3 to 7 days and if it gets denied and it's serious, simply make another issue about it. If you're SUPER worried, shoot me an email at emeraldosfoundation@gmail.com or ping my discord (either @ndeton or @theemeraldfoundation) and I'll respond, typically within 6 to 48 hours.

For security reasons, DMCA actions can only be emailed to emeraldosfoundation@gmail.com with the subject line below followed by where you see it, why you want it gone and proof you own it, limited to Gmail's email client. This cannot be a YAHOO! email as most tend to go to spam very quickly.

"[DMCA] + what you feel is DMCA worthy"

Example: 

[DMCA] The American Dollar

I see The American Dollar as the currency you have for the shop. I'd like it removed because you are German and I am American. In fact, I am Barack Obama. So give the american dollar back please. Proof I own it is here: (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) Attached is proof of me making the american dollar.
